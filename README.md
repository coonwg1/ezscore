# ðŸ“¢ What's New (June 2025)

**ezscore-f just got even better.**  
We've updated the model training pipeline to include **custom loss functions targeting class imbalance**, improving performance in minority classes such as **N1 sleep**.

The image below shows the updated model's confusion matrix on the same test set used in our original evaluation (Coon et al., 2025):

> **Figure**: Confusion matrix of the updated ezscore-f model, `ez6`.  `ez6` is the best-performing version of the model to-date.
> Notably improved classification of N1 sleep and better artifact separation, following the integration of custom loss functions during training.

# Install

### Install Python environment / package manager 
We use the `uv` package manager (you can skip this step if you already use `uv`).  You can find full install documentation here: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

For macOS and linux, you can use `curl` to download the script and execute it with sh:

    `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

If your system doesn't have `curl`, you can use `wget`:

    `wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

### Install ezscore
Once you have `uv` installed, you can install `ezscore-f` from Terminal after navigating to the directory of your choice:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coonwg1/ezscore.git
cd ezscore

uv venv
uv pip install -e .
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Test Installation
You can test the installation by running the demo script from a Terminal window like this:
```bash
python ezscore_demo.py
```

If everything installed correctly, the script should open a new figure window with a plot that looks like this:

</p>

> **Figure**: Demo script output using included sample data (ZMax EDFs) and the latest `ez6` model (corresponds to the confusion matrix above)...

And below are the "ground truth" sleep stages derived from concurrently recorded PSG and consensus scoring by multiple trained experts.
